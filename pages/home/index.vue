        The Vision Network is a distributed extensible virtual network, based on the physical network layer and the ISP
        network layer.<br/>The Vision Network is based on blockchain technology, which provides distributed services
        such as VPN, CDN, DNS, and DDoS attack protection. The Voken with stable value scale will be used in the ecology
        and produce an incentive effect. Everyone can participate in distributed network construction. We believe the
        Vision Network, a distributed Internet infrastructure will make the Internet more open, more equal, more stable,
        more efficient, safer and freer.

      <p>
        The existing network infrastructures in the world is physically connected. While ISPs (Internet Service
        Providers) provide users with network access services, they can centralize blockades and control your access.
        The Vision Network uses distributed peer-to-peer network technology to build a distributed, intelligent virtual
        network on the physical layer and ISP network layer. Through a large number of nodes, you can surely connect to
        the whole world.
